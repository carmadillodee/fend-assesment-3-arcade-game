## Instructions

Double-click index.html to open in your preferred browser and start the game. Alternatively, you can right-click and use 'Open As' while selecting your browser of choice to open the game if it is not your default application.

## Playing

Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move Laddybug () across the pathway to the river. Be sure to avoid the busy bugs as you cross. Cross the bug highway three times to win the game without losing your lives. You can keep track of your score and remaining lives on the scoreboard.
